## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a seasoned tech writer specializing in docs-as-code and enhancing the developer experience. I'm passionate about Markdown indentation, proper hyphen and em dash usage, API docs, AI, blockchain networks, Web3, and decentralization. I carry a growth and accountability mindset wherever I go, striving for daily self-improvement and to always act in accordance with my principles.

I'm actively studying Python, TypeScript, OpenAPI, and blockchain networks with the aim of contributing to a mission-focused team building in this space.
